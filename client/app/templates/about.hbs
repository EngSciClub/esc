            <p>
                EngSci Club is one of the several engineering discipline clubs connecting Engineering
                Science students with the faculty and the rest of the Skule. Think of us as a <em>mini</em> student body, in-between EngSci students
                and the <a href="http://skule.ca" target="_blank">Engineering Society</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Team</h3>

                representative. Say hi to any one of us when you see us around. We promise we won't bite!
