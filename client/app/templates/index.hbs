<h2>EngSci Anti-Calendar</h2>
<p>
     This is an open call for volunteers for an Anti-Calendar project being made by the EngSci Club. For those who aren't aware, we are currently trying to compile student reviews for courses in the EngSci options, and as such, we need people (like you all!) to help write them.
If you're interested in expressing opinions (strong, weak, positive, negative) about courses, or hoping to better prepare younger/prospective EngSci's, this is the place to do it!</p>

<p>Any interested people (we still need reviews for most courses in most options) should send an email to <a href="mailto:engsci.anticalendar@gmail.com">engsci.anticalendar@gmail.com</a>
</p>

<p>EngSci Club Exec</p>
